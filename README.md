# 🛒 Product Inventory Manager (ASP.NET Core MVC)

## 📘 Overview

The **Product Inventory Manager** is a C# ASP.NET Core MVC application that demonstrates how to manage products using a **Dictionary data structure**.
It allows users to **add, update, search, delete, and display** products, with each product stored by its unique **ProductID**.

The project highlights:

* Use of **Dictionary\<int, Product>** for inventory management.
* **CRUD operations** (Create, Read, Update, Delete).
* A **modern themed interface** (dark background with accent colors).
* User-friendly **navigation and search** features.

---

## 🎯 Aim of the Project

The aim is to **practice working with collections in C# (Dictionary)** and to learn how to build a functional, styled **MVC web application** that feels real-world and interactive.

---

## 🚀 Features

* ✅ Add new products with unique ProductID
* ✅ Edit existing product details (Name, Price)
* ✅ Delete products from inventory
* ✅ Search by **ProductID** or **Name**
* ✅ Display full product list in a styled table
* ✅ Fully responsive **MVC design with Bootstrap**

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

* **C# ASP.NET Core MVC** – Web framework
* **Dictionary\<int, Product>** – In-memory data storage
* **Bootstrap 5** – Responsive styling
* **Custom CSS theme** – Dark mode with accents
